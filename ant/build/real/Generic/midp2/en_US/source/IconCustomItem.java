/**
 * Allows to use an image along with text within one icon.
 * <p><b>Warning:</b> the item will be transformed into a J2ME Polish internal item in the preprocessing
 *      phase. This does not limit any of the features, but the construct <code>if (item instanceof CustomItem)</code> 
 *      will always return false if it is an IconCustomItem. Use <code>if (item instanceof IconCustomItem)</code> instead.
 *      <br />
 *      This is why this class is final, no subclassing is suported.
